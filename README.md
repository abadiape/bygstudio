#Bygstudio customers (producers) projects handling (admin page).
#Requires user and password to be accessed exclusively via htpps.
#Customers can be added, edited and deleted.
#Inside each customer you can create, edit and delete projects and their data. A project is normally a movie, a commercial or a TV series.
#Inside each project you can upload clips/trailers  to be seen for the corresponding customer.
#In order for the customer to see the new clip/trailer there are two options: 1. - Assign user and password to the customer, which grant them
#restrictive access just to their projects and related video material. Restrictive access means that the customer is just allowed to watch/
#download clips/trailers and their related info, they are not allowed to delete any material (videos) or modify them. 2. - Send an automated
#email to the customer every time an administrator uploads a clip to the server, this email contains the public url where the customer can
#watch the new edited/modified clip.
#Besides the aforementioned, there is a section where an administrator can upload, delete, re-order the material in the categories availa
#-ble to be seen in the public page. These are sample materials, usually short clips of video post-production work done by Bygstudio.
